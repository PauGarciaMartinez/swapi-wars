# About this project

## Language and Framework
```
For this project, I've used Javascript and Vue 3. 

Talking about Vue 3, I've worked with the Composition API for every script, using { ref } to bring reactivity to the elements. 

I've taken the communication between components via props and emits, 
as there was no need of using Vuex at this point.

### Logic and code documentation
```
In order to show the logic process that I've followed when coding 
this project, there are some comments that explain why I wrote 
that particular code. Hope it helps!
